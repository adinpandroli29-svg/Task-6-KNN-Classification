AI & ML Internship - Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors Classification


📌 Task 6: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

Objective:
To implement and analyze the KNN algorithm for classification.

Dataset Used:
Iris Dataset (loaded from sklearn.datasets).

Tools Used:

> Python

> Pandas

> Scikit-learn

> Matplotlib

> Seaborn

Steps Performed:

> Loaded and explored dataset

> Normalized features using StandardScaler

> Trained KNN classifier

> Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix

> Tested different K values

> Visualized accuracy vs K

> Plotted decision boundary

Conclusion:
KNN performance depends heavily on feature scaling and the choice of K. An optimal K balances bias and variance to achieve better classification accuracy.
